1. Implement save and cancel for Car Edit Row.

2. Upgrade Car Form to support Cancel in Edit Mode, but do not support cancel in Add Mode

3. When adding or deleting a car, if another row is in edit mode, discard the changes and revert the edit row to a view as part of adding or deleting.

Bonus:

1. When clicking on a column header, sort the table by that column. Display some kind of indicator telling which column is being sorted.

2. Dynamically generate the column headers for the table. Use best practices.
