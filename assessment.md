# React Assessment

Because we have some people in the class with React experience this assessment is to help me know how fast and advanced we can go from the start of the class. This is a no pressure thing. It's ok if you cannot complete it.

1. Create a Hobby Tool which manages a list of hobbies. The tool should have a header titled "Hobby Tool". The tool should display a list of strings which will be a list of hobbies such as "running", "knitting", "chess". 

2. At the bottom of the tool should be a form for collecting the name of a new hobby. The form should have one button, when the button is clicked, the new hobby should be added to the list.

3. Next to each hobby list item there should be a delete button. When the delete button is clicked the hobby list item should be removed.

4. Display the Hobby Tool from the `index.js`.

5. Ensure it works!
